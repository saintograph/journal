Hello! I'm Winfred from sunny Malaysia.

I'm excited about artificial intelligence, software engineering and robotics. My work covers web and mobile projects, from architecting software to laying continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

Competencies: Javascript, Python, C#/.NET, JS frameworks, DevOps, full-stack web development, chatbots, Android/iOS React-Native applications and cloud serverless computing (AWS Lambda).

If you represent a non-profit organisation, do write. I'd be glad to discuss a volunteer role to help your day-to-day operations with code and automation.

Outside of work I'm occupied with triathlons, electronics and 3D printing. Mastering new languages(the spoken kind!) are on my daily schedule as well.
