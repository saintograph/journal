Personal notes on goal-setting and knowledge retention when learning:

1. **Apply knowledge to alternative cases.**
   
   * knowing graph theory and applying path-finding to the Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg from an example provided by learning material is good. Applying it independently to cases such as social network analysis or species migration paths is a great way to cement the learning

2. **Set learning goals for the session and week.**
   
   * triathletes plan a season in advance by setting the training volume, duration and putting the schedule down in writing before committing to it. The same can be done for learning goals

3. **Don't stray.**
   
   * avoid going down a rabbit hole -  make a note of interesting topics you stumble upon while learning and make a note to return later.

4. **Make notes.** Write down everything from thoughts and observations to impressions. Why not learn from the best?

5. **Ear plugs!**

6. **Take time out**. Mental bandwidth takes time to recharge.
